## treehouseTechdegreeProject1RandomQuoteGenerator
My First Project of the Treehouse Tech Degree in Full Stack JavaScript Development
You'll use your growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:

Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice basic JavaScript skills while also creating a simple interactive 
portfolio piece to showcase your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## Create an array of JS objective which contains qoutes:
  - [x] Develop skills using JavaScript Loops
  - [x] Develop skills using JavaScript Arrays
  - [x] Develop skills using JavaScript Object Literals
  - [x] Develop skills declaring variables with Let and Const
  
 ## Array of Objects:
  
   Exceeds Expectations
   
  - [x] Array of Objects 
      
  - [x] is named `quotes` 
          
  - [x] contains at least 5 quote objects.
      
  - [x] is free of errors that prevent the code from running.
      
   Object Properties
   
   Exceeds expectations if meets expectations plus all of the following are true:
   
  - [x] All objects have `quote` and `source` properties.
      
   - [x] At least one object has `citation` property.
      
  - [x] At least one object has `year` property.
      
  - [x] At least one object has at least one additional property, such as `tags`.
      
  - [x] At least one additional property prints to the page with the its (`tags` property) quote.
      
  ## Create a function named `getRandomQuote` 
  
   getRandomQuote function:
   
  - [x] is named `getRandomQuote`:
      
  - [x] returns a random object from the `quotes` array.
    
  ## Create a function named `printQuote` :
   
    printQuote function:
    
  - [x] is named `printQuote`.
      
  - [x] calls the `getRandomQuote` function.
      
  - [x] prints a `quote` and a `source` property with every quote.
      
  - [x] prints a `citation` property with at least one quote.
      
  - [x] prints a `year` property with at least one quote.
      
  - [x] printed quotes match the format, layout and styles of the example quote in the `index.html` file.
      
  - [x] Quotes automatically refresh at regular intervals.
      
  - [x] Background color changes to a random color each time the quote refreshes.
      
    ##cCode comments :
    
  - [x] provided their own code comments.
